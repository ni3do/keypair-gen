# Private Key Generators in Rust

This repo implements private key generation in Rust. Currently only Ethereum is supported. Maybe other chains will be added in the future.

# Usage

Clone the repo:

    git clone

Install the dependencies:

    cargo install

Run the program:

    cargo run

Each run generates a new private/public keypair and prints it to console. The keys are not saved and can only be printed once.

## Backup your keys before using them. After running the program, the keys will no be recoverable!!!
